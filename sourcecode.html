        <ul>
            <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> A network that connects computers in a small, localized area, such as a home, office, or campus.</li>
            <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> A network that spans a large geographic area, such as the Internet.</li>
            <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> A network that covers a city or a large campus.</li>
            <li><strong>PAN (Personal Area Network):</strong> A network for personal devices, typically within a range of a few meters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance of Computer Networks</h2>
        <p>Computer networks play a crucial role in today's world, enabling communication, resource sharing, and access to information. They form the backbone of the Internet, powering industries, businesses, and personal communications.</p>
